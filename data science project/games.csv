Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.

Game is posing a question what if? What if Tianxian Empire was able to colonize Siberia before Russia did and later had started war to extend its ownership over the rest of Europe and America? Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

810740,Turtle Lu,"Mar 22, 2018",20000 - 50000,0,0,2.99,0,0,"Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes.

Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another.

But remember, after doing all the chores, you need to dedicate some time to the little joys available in your new routine BEFORE the clock strikes. If you don’t, you go insane, and it’s Game Over.

Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands.

About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics. Death too is a prevalent theme and no character, no matter how well known, how famous, or how integral to the plot, is safe from its cold hand! Despite its beautiful graphics, wondrous music, and humorous interludes, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a game, in places, designed to shock and appal, and where your decisions, no matter how noble can lead to devastating ends. Features: * Explore a free-roam world where you decide who to help and who to leave to their own fate. * Meet characters from ancient stories and rhymes such as Hansel and Gretel,or Little Red Riding Hood. * A unique magic system where strengthening one ability weakens another. * An addictive drug system, complete with dealers and quests. * An adult-themed RPG with political coups, terrorism, drugs, murder, and revenge. * Beautiful lands to explore. * A coming of age story with meaningful character progression. * Team up with interesting and powerful companions each with their own story, conversations, and personalities! * A day and night system where characters go to bed and monsters come out at night. * 14 hour story-line with many extra side quests, plus another 2 hour free bonus DLC 'The Maze of Cefgellin' * Play on after the story's end, doing quests, and building up your character and base camp. * Controller support, Mouse and Keyboard - full keybinding.",['English'],[],“Unhappy Ever After is the result of a wicked mind’s imagination!” 8/10 – OPN,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/header.jpg?t=1490429559,,http://warpedtales.weebly.com/,the.warped.tales@gmail.com,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,0,,0,16,10,,0,0,,218,0,218,0,Warped Tales,Warped Tales,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Adventure,Indie,RPG,RPGMaker,Dark Fantasy,Fantasy,Magic,Dark Comedy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_2633a000f0c52ddd4aaa4f6ba6f92315b72c6b32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_97f13cdc8e0f2efac222d00dcad65c2f9f786a92.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_845b2a32cc31afa264587e4bff3dfcb47780a7eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c643f2814b34930b2faae562237dd1336822c024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_1aaae69f2399d3df81056fcfa3ce28dcbff249ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_22f70f34e4a7e39fdb2aa9841748cc7bbb18ac7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_453a0e5bc82e5401a1742d7a955d5a1832a5d7b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_10a74a79352a5e13607fa2b7c732186d1c67d6e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_c81c5b477bc32a9ba0893a796bc7a5ba89ea0633.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_47190db23d847f648333e806eeddb925a1b0f4c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_65944ebf80f21df256b8f18b60a1c38deacff9a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_89840d572dbe7c7bb22c7796b0d511c75aaf0fe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_88d55d2249385460a434e802c4f73568dbeca5f0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_577784115f5550de311960100799a53cbf92a9de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_4faf9305ca187c787f315a3e1764181cdbfa5a38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_769552b5a36e2d56f3ccb013b155373c0e17f8ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_397be0fa648f76db83662d886f07c4f3de9d679c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_31aa64d32fa7b10b7f94ab51408210825056c842.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/552350/ss_0a8a52501655c6e2869376868bc5c7bd7ebc8046.1920x1080.jpg?t=1490429559",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256677348/movie_max.mp4?t=1483567252

231330,Deadfall Adventures,"Nov 15, 2013",100000 - 200000,4,0,19.99,0,0,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']","['English', 'German', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976,http://www.deadfall-game.com/,,support@quanticlab.com,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,53,https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/deadfall-adventures?ftag=MCD-06-10aaa1f,0,1716,628,,50,1140,,324,0,431,0,The Farm 51,THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"

The Garonne Mercenary Corps, which once resisted the Orc's attack, appeared to be more lonely after the head of the team disappeared. The sudden mission of the Rose broke the daily routine of the mercenary group that survived the struggle. Is it a trap? Still an opportunity? What is hidden behind the royal mission? Character introduction: Lei Lizhen: The ace of the Garon Mercenary The 18-year-old girl has calmness and indifference that is inconsistent with her appearance. And the beginning of all this stems from an accident in childhood. Although it is a childhood friend, the relationship between the two has been extremely close. But the trauma of childhood makes RAYMOND 异常 very sensitive to parting. As she grew older, she chose to close her heart and wait for people to become cold. Once thought that power would be omnipotent. She is even more convinced that the world itself is a 'weak meat and strong food', but she does not know that such cognition also shuts out other people's concern for her. Linasha: The appearance is only 12 years old, but has a age of nearly 30 years old. Unlike the cute and well-behaved appearance, as the main magician of the Garon mercenary group Known as the 'flame elf', she not only has superb magical ability. And the love of mischief, so that the mercenary group of people have a headache. But at the same time, Lina Shah was slightly emotional, and even when she was a little bit of trouble, she even felt pitiful. No one knows what she experienced before coming to the Garon Mercenary No one has ever seen what she is behind that smiley face.

If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path.

1557480,Project MIKHAIL: A Muv-Luv War Story,"Nov 1, 2021",20000 - 50000,16,0,19.99,0,0,"-It’s Your Responsibility to Change the World- Set on an Earth where mankind is being steadily annihilated by the alien invaders known as the BETA. Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that’s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player’s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they’ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player’s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world? Come up with your own plans, or work with other players to learn secrets you could never find on your own, revealing these factions’ deepest secrets and saving the world from destruction. [PvP Mode] A player vs player combat mode. Players join two teams of 4 TSF pilots and battle one another. The Early Access version of PvP is still in beta, but in the future we’ll be adding: ・More TSFs to fight in. ・Voice chat ・Balance changes and roles to make team play more fun.","['English', 'Japanese']","['English', 'Japanese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/header.jpg?t=1652940346,https://www.project-mikhail.com,https://project-mikhail.com/en/support/,support-mikhail-en@ancr.jp,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,328,253,,0,563,,670,0,670,0,"aNCHOR Inc.,fuzz, Inc.",aNCHOR Inc.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Anime,Mechs,Hack and Slash,Strategy,Sci-fi,Simulation,Dark,Robots,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,RPG,Action,Third Person,Adventure,Tactical,Swordplay,Spectacle fighter,Early Access,PvP,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_99d86dcae78e23378dc1a5da0a65abf3a472e09c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9d4c4aa8936728fba70562df891b3f173b1a6428.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_8019583ecbf9fa9ce1f0d6e43623e5c8cb507475.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_9cc13a574d7a0286f74195c6610fa4b41e9a28c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_0a3840381970cb1d9487d8024a477d106fe5b31f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_7c4620218a3c3ce260bb5300578d30343a29c8f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_1a9482cae60ddc8ada6a7f343666a661b401bc8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_960b58bb69e087c8b558c668fc4c7a2cc3aa1d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_07439c6cc1ad6a558a1510dc74ab0673e989f2fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_003cc058eea0de30292c8fb6029d8fee137441d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1557480/ss_e653d2d90e5b13bee943cc2cd3f9aa8e981b4111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1652940346","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256847596/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361467,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256858534/movie_max.mp4?t=1635832857,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256857340/movie_max.mp4?t=1635361475"
1128520,Rezist: Tower Defense,"Sep 26, 2019",0 - 20000,0,0,0.99,0,0,"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system — your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/header.jpg?t=1589792761,,,hydrargyrum2.0@gmail.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,,0,8,0,,0,0,,0,0,0,0,SparkGames,SparkGames,Single-player,"Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_4be639c00f5f0aebe2af86ee8c5b45f6a8f674a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_016c6384567bc24e253133bcb075416e92c69ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_2d1b02e13cf6056b6413f82346bdedc6263ab9d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_e587cf3a36df2bbbfcec630d44921ad0ba3f4bbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_c5d0e1447b631236160fe332bbecb23b2b91fed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_52dc9d15a04744562d88298b5e9eec9caec62f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_717b8e12f40a7cb4b4e9613b19d4f15aa60fddb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760113/movie_max.mp4?t=1567602189

Master and summon 15 different spirits with unique abilities. 15+ hours of story and gameplay. SUMMARY In a regional city in the present day, Sayaka Mimuro manages her family's Shinto shrine on behalf of her absent parents. Along with her childhood friend Haru and a talking furball (rabbit?) god, she lives a peaceful life, but when an earthquake strikes, aggressive spirits suddenly appear and her world is torn apart. Sayaka receives divine tidings that the only one who can save the city is herself—she's actually an Onmyoji with the power to vanquish spirits! However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man... '...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!' Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight... 'There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?' With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals. With his help, Sayaka finally unlocks her battle-princess powers to wage war on the spirits that ravage her city... CHARACTER Heroine: Sayaka Mimuro Voice: Yui Sakakibara “Nothing is impossible if you give it your all.” A hardworking and beautiful girl with a strong sense of justice. Although Sayaka herself doesn't know it, she's descended from a line of Onmyoji sorcerers, and the powers of exorcism slumber within her. She was brought up to be responsible, and she'll never abandon anyone in need. She also tries to see the best in every situation—even the bad one that her dutiful nature has gotten her into now. When it comes to love, she has as much of an interest as anyone else, but the shrine work she does in her parents' stead has always kept her too busy to date.

Good-Knight is a Butt-clenching Arcade Metal Game influenced by games like Super-Hexagon, Castlevania, and Touhou. It's almost genre-less as it fuses genres like Shooters Rhythm Puzzle Bullet-Hell. Game Play You only need one button because you only have one job- survive from the bullet hell! Use the arrow key or joystick to aim your attack. Destroy the bullet shooting enemy can make your survival much easier, but definitely not necessary.

For rookies, we recommend using the bullet time button when the situation is intensified. It can save you anytime you want, the knight has already mastered this ability so that you can unlimitedly use it. However, 'Don't abuse it! You will be punished for playing with time!' -Said by a wise guy. Compete with your friends and players around the world on the leaderboard!

Mixed culture: Philippine horrors, history and literature fuse with Greek stories “You got a reverse Centaur (a man with a head of a horse) called Tikbalang, a Smoking treeman who smokes so much, that creates fog so people get lost in the mountains, and the Aswang which is a traditional Vampire but with a twist where it dislocates its lower body and flies away looking for victims at night.” -Zaid Al-Shaheed, co-founder of Team Good Knight Experience the blockbuster visual and audio enjoyment -Atmosphere rendering inspired by Devil May Cry and Castlevania . -Multiple camera angles: automatically angle switch follows game progress. -Original metal soundtrack. -Plus your neat game control! Invite your friends to play with you! Online or in-person.

Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency.

1886290,Slot Shots Pinball Collection,"Jun 21, 2022",0 - 20000,1,0,9.99,0,0,"Pinball is BACK! Slot Shots Pinball Collection Early Access features five tables, with one more table planned to release over the coming months for a total of at least six tables playable in this collection. Also included in the Early Access is a score attack mode- a one minute multiball thriller with increased mission and slot payouts (and each mode has its own separate online leaderboard system)! Super Vixel Land - A retro themed pixel/voxel super wide table that has missions on both the upper playfield and a lower playfield that has a revolving wheel! Slot Shots Casino - A fantasy themed casino playground that features a fully functional slot machine, which has a total of ten payouts based on your slot machine roll. This table also has a spinning lucky wheel in the back that grants various different awards based on where the ball drops down the wheel! Bass Hunter - A fishing themed table that also features its own custom slot machine. In Bass Hunter you will be completing fishing themed missions, such as catching the 'legendary' fish, while also collecting high scores from activating the slot machine that features different fish and tackle. Neon Nights 2 Skylines - A cyberpunk styled purple and blue neon themed table with a pulse pounding synth style soundtrack. Outergalactic Aliens - A remake of last year's table with all new LEDs, and the addition of the slot machine. PLEASE NOTE: This title is built on the Unity engine and there is a slight delay while playing if you use BOTH shift keys at the same time to control the flippers. This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. The entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. Features full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. What do the Steam curators have to say about this title? Check it out!
